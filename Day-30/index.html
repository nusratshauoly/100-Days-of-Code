<!-- step-1: You will be building a happy Flappy Penguin, and further exploring CSS transforms and animations in the process.
Begin with your basic HTML boilerplate. Include the DOCTYPE declaration, html element with a language set to English, the appropriate meta tags, a head, body, and title element. Also, link your stylesheet to the page.

    <!-- step-13:To create some scenery in the background, you will add two mountains.
Above the .penguin element, add a div with a class of left-mountain.  -->
    <div class="left-mountain"></div>
    <!-- step-19:To give the effect of a mountain range, add another mountain, by creating a new div immediately after .left-mountain, and give the new div the class of back-mountain. -->
    <div class="back-mountain"></div>
    <!-- step-24: To finish the background, add a sun, by creating a new div element immediately after the .back-mountain element, and give it the class of sun. -->
    <div class="sun"></div>
    <!-- step-10: Above the .ground element, add a div with a class of penguin. This div will contain Flappy Penguin. -->
    <div class="penguin">
    <!--step-28:Your penguin will consist of two main sections: the head, and the body.
Within .penguin, add two new div elements. The first with a class of penguin-head, and the second with a class of penguin-body. -->
        <div class="penguin-head">
<!-- step-44: Start the penguin's face, by adding two div elements within .penguin-head, and giving them both a class of face. -->
<!-- step-48: Currently, the two .face elements are on top of each other.
Fix this, by adding a class of left to the first .face element, and a class of right to the second .face element.
 -->
           <div class="face left"></div>
           <div class="face right"></div>
<!-- step-51: Below the .face.right element, add a div element with a class of chin. -->
           <div class="chin"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="penguin-body"></div>
    </div>
    <!-- step-6:Within the body, add a div with a class of ground.  -->
