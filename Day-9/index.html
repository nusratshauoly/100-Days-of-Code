<!-- step-1:Begin with your standard HTML boilerplate. Add a DOCTYPE declaration, an html element, a head element, and a body element.
Add the lang attribute to the opening <html> tag with en set as the value. -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <!-- step-2 Within your head element, add a meta tag with the name set to viewport and the content set to width=device-width, initial-scale=1.
Also add a meta tag with the charset set to UTF-8.:-->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!-- step-3:Within your head element, add a title element with the text set to Photo Gallery, and a link element to add your styles.css file to the page. -->
    
    <title>Photo Gallery</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- step-4:Add a header element within the body element and assign a class of header to it.
Inside the header, create an h1 with css flexbox photo gallery as the text. -->
    <header class="header">
          <h1>css flexbox photo gallery</h1>
         
    </header>
<!-- step-5: Passed
Below your .header element, create a new div element and assign it a class of "gallery". This div will act as a container for the gallery images.
Inside that .gallery element, create nine img elements.-->

<!-- step-6: Next, give each img a src attribute according to its order in the document. The first img should have a src of https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-photo-gallery/1.jpg. The rest should be the same, except replace the 1 with the number the img is in the document.-->
    <div class="gallery">
    <!-- step-21: The alt image attribute should describe the image content. Screen readers announce the alternative text in place of images. If the image can't be loaded, this text is presented in place of the image.

To complete the project, add an alt attribute to all nine of your cat images to describe them. Use a value at least five characters long for each.-->
        <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-photo-gallery/1.jpg" alt="Image of a sleeping cat.">
        <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-photo-gallery/2.jpg" alt="Image of a sulking cat">
        <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-photo-gallery/3.jpg" alt="Image of a angry cat">
