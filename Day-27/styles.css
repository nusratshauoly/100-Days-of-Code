/* step-10: You will also need to target the pseudo-elements, which are special keywords that follow a selector. The two pseudo-elements you will be using are the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements.
The ::before selector creates a pseudo-element which is the first child of the selected element, while the ::after selector creates a pseudo-element which is the last child of the selected element. These pseudo-elements are often used to create cosmetic content, which you will see later in this project.
For now, create a CSS selector to target all elements with *, and include the pseudo-elements with ::before and ::after. Set the box-sizing property to inherit. */

In the new selector, set the background-color to #1d1e22. Also set the content property to "". This will make the pseudo-elements empty.
The content property is used to set or override the content of the element. By default, the pseudo-elements created by the ::before and ::after pseudo-selectors are empty, and the elements will not be rendered to the page.
