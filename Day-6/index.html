<!-- step-1: Start by adding the !DOCTYPE html declaration at the top of the document so the browser knows what type of document it's reading. -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- step-2:Below the DOCTYPE, add an html element with a lang attribute set to en, so that you have a place to start putting some code. -->
<html lang="en">
 <!-- step-3: add head and body  -->
 <head>
<!-- step-4:Add a title and a meta elements to the head. Give your project a title of Registration Form, and give a charset attribute with a value of UTF-8 to your meta element. -->
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Registration Form</title>
<!-- step-5:Nest a self-closing link element within the head element. Give it a rel attribute with value of stylesheet and an href attribute with a value of styles.css. -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>

<body>
    
<!-- step-6: Within the body, provide a heading context for the content, by adding an h1 with the text Registration Form. -->
<h1>Registration Form</h1>

<!-- step-7: Below the heading, use the following text within a paragraph element to encourage users to register:-->
<p>Please fill out this form with the required information</p>

<!-- step-11: As suggested by the title, you are creating a form. So, after the p element, insert a form with an action attribute targeting https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org.-->
<form action="https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org">

<!--step-12: As the form will have three distinct sections, add three fieldset elements within the form element.-->
<fieldset>
<!-- step-13:The first fieldset will hold name, email, and password fields. Start by adding four label elements to the first fieldset. -->
<!-- step-14:Add the following text to the label elements: -->
<!-- step-16:Nest an input element within each label. Be sure to add each input after the label text, and include a space after the colon -->
<!-- step-17:Give the first two input elements a type attribute of text, the third a type attribute of email, and the fourth a type attribute of password.
The email type only allows emails with a @ and a . in the domain. The password type obscures the input, and warns if the site does not use HTTPS. -->
<!-- step-19:To make the form more interactive, add the required attribute to the input elements in the first fieldset -->
    <label for="">Enter Your First Name:
<!-- step-37: With form submissions, it is useful, and good practice, to provide each submittable element with a name attribute. This attribute is used to identify the element in the form submission.
Give each submittable element a unique name attribute of your choosing, except for the two radio inputs.-->
         <input type="text" name="first" required>
    </label>
    <label for="">Enter Your Last Name: <input type="text" name="last" required>
    </label>
    <label for="">Enter Your Email: <input type="email" required>
       
    </label>
    <input type="email" name="email" id="">
    <label for="">Create a New Password:
        <!-- step-20: Add custom validation to the password input element, by adding a minlength attribute with a value of 8. Doing so prevents inputs of less than 8 characters being submitted. -->
        <input type="password" minlength="8" pattern="[a-z0-5]{8,}" name="password" required>
       
<!-- step-21: Add a pattern attribute to the password input element to require the input match: [a-z0-5]{8,}
The above is a regular expression which matches eight or more lowercase letters or the digits 0 to 5. Then, remove the minlength attribute, and try it out.-->
         <input type="password" pattern="[a-z0-5]{8,}" required>
    </label>
</fieldset>


<fieldset>
<!--step-22: Start by adding three label elements to the second fieldset.-->
<label for="">
<!-- step-23:Users will be allowed to choose either a Personal Account or Business Account.
To do this, within each of the first two label elements, add one input element with type="radio" -->
<!-- step-25:Within each corresponding label element, and immediately after the input element, add a space and add the following text:
Personal Account
Business Account
I accept the terms and conditions -->
<!-- step=26: To relate the radio inputs, give them the same name attribute with a value of account-type. Now, it is not possible to select both radio inputs at the same time. -->
<!-- step-45: For the second fieldset, you want the input and label text to appear on the same line.
Start, by giving the input elements in the second fieldset a class of inline.-->
<input  type="radio" name="account-type" class="inline" id=""> Personal Account
</label>
<label for="">
    <input class="inline" type="radio" name="account-type" id=""> Business Account  
</label>
<!-- step-24:For the terms and conditions, add an input with a type of checkbox to the third label element. Also, as we do not want users to sign up, without having read the terms and conditions, make it required. -->
<label for="">
    <!-- step-27:To finish this fieldset off, link the text terms and conditions in the third label to the following location: -->
  <input type="checkbox" name="terms" id=""class="inline" required> I accept the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/terms-of-service/">terms and conditions</a>
</label>
</fieldset>
<fieldset>
<!-- step-28: Well, the input type file allows just that. Add a label with the text Upload a profile picture: , and add an input accepting a file upload. -->
<label for="">
    <input type="file" name="file" id="">Upload a profile picture: 
</label>
<!-- step-29:Add another label after the first, with the text Input your age (years): . Then, nest an input with the type of number.
As we do not want users under the age of 13 to register, add a min attribute to the input with a value of 13. Also, we can probably assume users over the age of 120 will not register; add a max attribute with a value of 120.
Now, if someone tries to submit the form with values outside of the range, a warning will appear, and the form will not submit. Give it a try. -->
<label for="">
    <input type="number" name="age" id="" min="13" max="120">Input your age (years):
</label>
<!-- step-30:Adding a dropdown to the form is easy with the select element. The select element is a container for a group of option elements, and the option element acts as a label for each dropdown option. Both elements require closing tags.
Start, by adding a select element below the two label elements. Then, nest 5 option elements within the select element. -->
<!-- step-31:Nest the select element (with its option elements) within a label element with the text How did you hear about us?. The text should come before the select element. -->
<label for="">How did you hear about us?
<select name="select-option" id="">
<!--step-32:The dropdown options are currently empty. To give them content, add the following text to each subsequent option element: -->
<!-- step-33:Submitting the form with an option selected would not send a useful value to the server. As such, each option needs to be given a value attribute. Without which, the text content of the option will be submitted to the server.
Give the first option a value of "", and the subsequent option elements value attributes from 1 to 4. -->
    <option value="">(select one)</option>
    <option value="1">freeCodeCamp News</option>
    <option value="2">freeCodeCamp YouTube Channel</option>
    <option value="3">freeCodeCamp Forum</option>
    <option value="4">Other</option>
    
</select>
</label>
<!-- step-34: Users will be able to register with a bio. Add a label with the text Provide a bio: at the end of the fieldset. Add a textarea element inside the label element. Note that the textarea requires a closing tag. -->
<label for="">Provide a bio: 
<!-- step-35:The textarea appears too small. To give it an initial size, you can add the rows and cols attributes.
Add an initial size of 3 rows and 30 columns. -->

<!-- step-36:To give Campers an idea of what to put in their bio, the placeholder attribute is used. The placeholder accepts a text value, which is displayed until the user starts typing.
Give the textarea a placeholder of I like coding on the beach....  -->
    <textarea rows="3" cols="30" placeholder="I like coding on the beach...." name="description"></textarea>
     </label>
    
</fieldset>


<!-- step-18: The first input element with a type of submit is automatically set to submit its nearest parent form element.
To handle the form submission, after the last fieldset element add an input element with the type attribute set to submit and the value attribute set to Submit.-->
<input type="submit" value="Submit">
    
</form>
</body>
</html>
