/* step-8: Your images are too big. Create a .gallery img selector to target them. Give them all a width of 100% and a max-width of 350px so they shrink as needed but don't get too big.
Also set the height property to 300px to keep your images a uniform size.*/
.gallery img{
    width:100%;
    max-width: 350px;
    height: 300px;

/* step-11:To use it, give an element a display property of flex. This will make the element a flex container. Any direct children of a flex container are called flex items.
Create a .gallery selector and make it a flex container. */
.gallery{

/* step-12:Flexbox has a main and cross axis. The main axis is defined by the flex-direction property, which has four possible values:
row (default): horizontal axis with flex items from left to right
row-reverse: horizontal axis with flex items from right to left
column: vertical axis with flex items from top to bottom
column-reverse: vertical axis with flex items from bottom to top .
Note: The axes and directions will be different depending on the text direction. The values shown are for a left-to-right text direction.
Try the different values to see how they affect the layout.
When you are done, set an explicit flex-direction of row on the .gallery element.*/
flex-direction: row;

/* step-13:The flex-wrap property determines how your flex items behave when the flex container is too small. Setting it to wrap will allow the items to wrap to the next row or column. nowrap (default) will prevent your items from wrapping and shrink them if needed.

Make it so your flex items wrap to the next row when they run out of space. */
flex-wrap: wrap;

/* step-14:The justify-content property determines how the items inside a flex container are positioned along the main axis, affecting their position and the space around them.

Give your .gallery selector a justify-content property with center as the value. */
justify-content: center;

/* step-15: The align-items property positions the flex content along the cross axis. In this case, with your flex-direction set to row, your cross axis would be vertical.

To vertically center your images, give your .gallery selector an align-items property with center as the value.*/
align-items: center;

/* step-16: Give your .gallery selector a padding property set to 20px 10px to create some space around the container.

Then, give it a max-width of 1400px and add a margin of 0 auto to center it.*/
padding: 20px 10px;
max-width: 1400px;
margin: 0 auto;

/* step-18: Your images need some space between them.

The gap CSS shorthand property sets the gaps, also knowns as gutters, between rows and columns. The gap property and its row-gap and column-gap sub-properties provide this functionality for flex, grid, and multi-column layout. You apply the property to the container element.

Give your .gallery flex container a gap property with 16px as the value.*/
gap:16px;

}

/* step-20:The ::after pseudo-element creates an element that is the last child of the selected element. We can use it to add an empty element after the last image. If we give it the same width as the images it will push the last image to the left when the gallery is in a two-column layout. Right now, it is in the center because we set justify-content: center on the flex container. 

Example:

.container::after {
  content: "";
  width: 860px;
}
Create a new selector using an ::after pseudo-element on the .gallery element. Add a content property set to an empty string "" and 350px set for the width property.
