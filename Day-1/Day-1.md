# Day-1
I am  learning HTML . I am learning HTML by Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App.

I learnt the following:

1. **Open and Close tags** `<h1></h1> , <h2></h2> , <h3></h3> , <h4></h4> , <h5></h5> , <h6></h6>` : HTML elements have opening and closing tags like.  
2. **Paragraph tag** `<p></p>` : The p element is used      to create a paragraph of text on websites
3. **Comment** `<!--  -->` : Commenting allows you to leave messages without affecting the browser display. It also allows you to make code inactive.
4. **Nesting** `<main></main>` : HTML5 has some elements that identify different content areas. These elements make your HTML easier to read and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.
5. **Intendation** : Nested elements should be placed two spaces further to the right of the element they are nested in. This spacing is called indentation and it is used to make HTML easier to read.
6. **Image tag** `<img src="" alt="">` : You can add images to your website by using the img element. img elements have an opening tag without a closing tag. A tag for an element without a closing tag is known as a self-closing tag.
    * **src attribute** `<img src="https://www.example.com/the-image.jpg">` : HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag of an element to control the element's behavior. The src attribute in an img element specifies the image's URL (where the image is located).
    * **alt attribute** `<img src="cat.jpg" alt="A cat">` : All img elements should have an alt attribute. The alt attribute's text is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load.
7. **Anchor element** `<a href='https://github.com/'`></a>: You can link to another page with the anchor (a) element.
   * **target attribute** `<p> <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Click Here</a></p>` : Add a target attribute with the value _blank to the anchor (a) element's opening tag, so that the link opens in a new tab.
   * **Text into link** `<p><a href='https://github.com/'></a></p>`: You can add p or h tag on anchor element.
   * **Image into link** `<a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank"> <img src="https://www.example.com/the-image.jpg" alt="My github link">Click here</a>` : Turn the image into a link by surrounding it with necessary element tags.
8. **Section element** `<section></section>` : You can keep all elements inside section element.
9. **ul element** `<ul></ul>` : Unordered list.
10. **ol element** `<ol></ol>` : Ordered list.
    * **li element** `<li></li>` : Use list item (li) elements to create items in a list.
11. **figure element** `<figure></figure>` :The figure element represents self-contained content and will allow you to associate an image with a caption. 
12. **figcaption element** `<figcaption></figcaption>` : A figure caption (figcaption) element is used to add a caption to describe the image contained within the figure element.
13. **em element** ` <em>Cat</em>` : You can emphasis with this element.
