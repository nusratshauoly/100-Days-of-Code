<!-- step-1: Welcome to the CSS Variables Skyline project! Start by adding the !DOCTYPE html declaration at the top of the document so the browser knows what type of document it's reading.-->

    <!-- step-8:Create a div element in the body with a class of background-buildings. This will be a container for a group of buildings. -->

 
    <div class="background-buildings">
<!-- step-21: The buildings are too spaced out. Squeeze them together by adding two empty div elements to the top of the .background-buildings element, two more at the bottom of it, and one more in between .bb3 and .bb4. These will be added as evenly-spaced elements across the container, effectively moving the buildings closer to the center.

-->
       <div></div>
       <div></div>
<!-- step-10:Nest a div with a class of bb1 in the background buildings container. Open your styles.css file, and give .bb1 a width of 10% and height of 70%. "bb" stands for "background building", this will be your first building.-->

       <div class="bb1 building-wrap">
<!-- step-11:Nest four div elements in the .bb1 container. Give them the classes bb1a, bb1b, bb1c, and bb1d in that order. This building will have four sections. -->
<!-- step-42:  Add the new bb1-window class to the .bb1a, .bb1b, and .bb1c elements. This will apply the gradient to them.-->
