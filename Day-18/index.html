<!-- step-2: Within your body element, nest a section element within a main element.-->
    <main>
        <section>
<!-- step-3:Within your section element, add an h1 element with a nested span element. -->
<!-- step-4:Give your existing span the class attribute set to flex, and add two span elements within it. Give the first the text AcmeWidgetCorp. Give the second the text Balance Sheet. You will use CSS to reverse the order of the text on the page, but the HTML order will make more sense for a screen reader. -->

                    <span>AcmeWidgetCorp</span>

            </span></h1>
<!-- step-5:Below your h1 element, create a div element. Give it an id attribute set to years. You want this particular element to be hidden from screen readers, so give it the aria-hidden attribute set to true. -->
            <div id="years" aria-hidden="true">

            </div>
<!-- step-7: Below your existing div element, add a new div element with a class set to table-wrap. This will be the container for your tables.
Within that, add three table elements. You will be using CSS to style these into a single table, but using separate tables will help screen readers understand the document flow. -->

Add a caption element to your first table, and give it the text Assets. -->

Leave the td element empty. This element exists only to ensure your table has a four-column layout and associate the headers with the correct columns.
